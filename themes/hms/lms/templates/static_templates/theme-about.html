<p>HMX, a new online learning initiative from Harvard Medical School, brings to bear the vast medical knowledge, clinical expertise, and academic excellence of Harvard Medical School through online educational experiences.  </p>

<p>Brought to you by the Office of Online Learning within HMS External Education, HMX advances the notion that digital technologies should enhance the collaborative and personal nature of effective healthcare training. Led by Dr. Michael J Parker, Faculty Director of Online Learning, HMX creates online programming that is engaging, compassionate, collaborative, and rigorous—bringing forth all of the educational innovation and excellence you’ve come to expect from Harvard Medical School. </p>

<h2>HMX Fundamentals — Get ahead, Stay ahead.</h2>

<p>Piloting in the summer of 2015, the HMS External Education Office of Online Learning launches its inaugural series—HMX Fundamentals. Developed with leading HMS faculty members and a skilled team of clinicians, educators, and creative production experts, the two-module series is designed to give pre-health students a head start in their first year of training. </p>

<p>The series modules focus on key foundational concepts in Physiology and Immunology, taking traditionally difficult-to-learn concepts and applying the latest educational research and digital technologies to enhance the student experience. Crafted with clinical relevance and student engagement in mind, HMX Fundamentals features:</p>

<ul>
<li>True-to-life Scenarios that give students a contextual framework for exploring concepts, providing relevance and integration of key principles through storytelling. </li>
<li>Dynamic Animations that combine illustrative visuals with narration to guide learners through complex processes in a step-by-step, self-paced way.  </li>
<li>Concept Videos that take advantage of faculty’s expertise to explain key concepts in digestible segments, using writing, drawing, and animations along with conversational tone.</li>
<li>On Site Videos that take learners inside the hospital or other clinical setting with outstanding HMS clinicians or inside the research labs of world-class scientists.  Designed to demonstrate the clinical relevance and significance of the foundational topics learners are studying, these videos provide applications of knowledge and a glimpse into students’ potential futures.</li>
<li>Interactives that guide learners through a topic by encouraging active engagement and experimentation with simulations and other uniquely responsive visuals.</li>
<li>Interleaved Assessments that provide feedback, enhance learning, and allow students to self-evaluate and measure their progress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Faculty</h2>


<h3>Michael J. Parker, MD</h3>

<p>Faculty Director of Online Learning</p>

<p>External Education, Harvard Medical School</p>


<p>A physician in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dr. Parker is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at HMS and was formerly the senior interactive media architect in the HMS Center for Educational Technology.  Dr. Parker received Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. Before becoming a physician, he worked in the software industry and then studied exercise physiology at University of Colorado while performing biomechanical analysis of U.S. team cyclists at the Olympic Training Center. He went to medical school at the University of Colorado and returned to Boston for internal medicine residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital.  A former Rabkin Fellow in Medical Education, Dr. Parker is an accomplished teacher, combining his computer science and medical knowledge to create animations and simulations that enhance the teaching and learning of complex medical concepts.  He has received local and national recognition for his work. </p>


<h3>Richard M. Schwartzstein, MD </h3>
<p>Ellen and Melvin Gordon Professor of Medicine and Medical Education</p>
<p>Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>Since joining the HMS faculty in 1986, Dr. Schwartzstein has been a member of the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Beth Israel Hospital and now, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). In addition to his clinical work and research on the physiology of dyspnea, Dr. Schwartzstein has devoted a substantial portion of his career to medical education. He has been course director for Integrated Human Physiology, one of the core courses in the first year curriculum for 20 years and has served on multiple committees with oversight of the HMS program of studies; he is chair of the Steering Committee overseeing the development of a new pre-clerkship curriculum at Harvard. In 2004, he was named the vice president for education at BIDMC, where he created the first hospital-based Center for Education in the Harvard system. Dr. Schwartzstein is also the executive director of the Carl J. Shapiro Institute for Education and Research at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and director of the HMS Academy of Educators. The Institute supports the Rabkin Fellowship in Medical Education, sponsors national conferences on key educational topics biannually, provides a range of professional development activities for physicians, and oversees the Shapiro Simulation and Skills Center. Dr. Schwartzstein has a particular interest in the cognitive processes underlying analytical reasoning and the strategies for teaching and assessing critical thinking.</p>


<h3>Shiv Pillai, MD, PhD </h3>
<p>Professor of Medicine and Health Sciences and Technology</p>
<p>Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>Dr. Pillai is the Program Director of an NIH Funded Autoimmune Center of Excellence at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Director of the Masters in Medical Sciences in Immunology Program at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Pillai coined the term “surrogate light chains” for proteins that he identified (with David Baltimore), as part of a novel receptor, now known as the pre-B receptor,  that drives early B cell development. His laboratory at MGH postulated and provided evidence for the first ligand-independent signaling model during lymphocyte development, now a widely accepted mechanism for both pre-B receptor and pre-T receptor signaling. His laboratory also showed that Btk, the product of the gene mutated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia, is functionally linked to the pre-B receptor and the B cell receptor. His group defined a functional niche for B cells (around sinusoids in the bone marrow), identified the first two mutants that abrogate marginal zone B lymphocyte development, developed the concept of a follicular versus marginal zone B lymphoid cell-fate decision, and discovered two new defined stages of peripheral B cell development, the marginal zone precursor (MZP) B cell, and the Follicular type II B cell. Dr. Pillai is also the co-author of two widely used textbooks of immunology and is the course director of immunology courses at Harvard Medical School, Harvard College and for the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies.</p>

<h3>Andrew H. Lichtman, MD, PhD</h3>
<p>Professor of Pathology</p>
<p>Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>Andrew H. Lichtman, MD, PhD is a Professor in the Department of Pathology at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. He has taught in, directed, and developed Immunology and Pathology courses at Harvard Medical School for over 30 years. He is a co-author of the highly regarded Basic Immunology, 4th Edition and Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 7th Edition. Dr. Lichtman received his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Rochester School of Medicine, after which he was a Pathology resident at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He is board certified in Anatomic Pathology. Dr. Lichtman’s laboratory research program focuses on T lymphocyte mediated immunity, where he studies the mechanisms of migration of different effector T cell subsets into tissues, and immunologic aspects of cardiovascular disease.</p>
